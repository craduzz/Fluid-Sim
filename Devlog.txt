*** for the first task, I added a for each loop that loops the creation of density fields and vector forces in the fluid sim
    after adding the for loops I implemented a quick txt input for the user to add the coordinates for their density locations and the vector forces(and its direction)

    the density input is set that the first two numbers define the height and the next 2 numbers define de width

    the velocity input is set that the first two numbers define the x and y coordinates of the origin and the next 2 numbers define the strength and the direction

***To change the color I added the parameter color to both the arrows of the velocity vectors and the density mass
    this worked for the vector arrows but it wasn't working for the density mass, after researching matplotlib colors I came to the conclusion of using cmaps for the density colors and it worked

*** to add animations to the vector forces, I used the frame number and passed it to a sine and cosine function so that it created a circular and semi circular motion

*** To place an object I intended to use the function declared in the class fluid, but there was no way to add an object from calling it as an object. Instead i added a range inside the method set_boundries and
    set that range value to 0 which meant that in that range there is an object
